    <div class = "awake">
        <p> You wake up in a strange desert. The heats beating on your neck as you sit up and you suffer from a massive headache. Do you get up or go back to sleep?

        </p>
<span><p class = "getUp">Get Up</p>
<p class = "zzz"> Go To Sleep</p>
</span>
    </div>
    <div class = "gotUp">
<p>You get up and see some guards charging at you, they have weapons, do you engage them or run away?
</p>
<span><p class = "engage">Fight</p>
<p class = "escape">Run away</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "sleep">
<p>And you died. Why? Well how would you know, you were asleep? Try being more productive next time.
</p>
<span><p class = "restart">Restart</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "attack">
<p>You defeat the knights with ease and you realize your power grows. You then come across a plant monster(in the desert?) Do you spare or fight?
</p>
<span><p class = "engage-engage">Fight</p>
<p class = "engage-escape">Spare</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "spare">
<p>You ran away on the side of caution and the hopes of a possible misunderstanding. You then wander into the territory of a plant monster. Do you run or fight it?
</p>
<span><p class = "escape-engage">Fight</p>
<p class = "escape-escape">Run</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "attack-attack">
<p style="color:black;">You defeat the monster with your powers and with it new powers emerge. Up ahead you can see a town do you approach the town or do you wait back for awhile? </p>
<span><p style="color:black;" class = "engage-engage-engage">move Forward</p>
<p  style="color:black;" class = "engage-engage-escape">Wait</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "attack-spare" id  = "textColor">
<p style="color:black;">You leave the plant monster be and move past it, as you did you could feel something that was almost human inside it. You see the resemblance of a town. Do you move forward or wait awhile?
</p>
<span><p  style="color:black;" class = "engage-escape-engage">Move Forward</p>
<p  style="color:black;" class = "engage-escape-escape">Wait</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "spare-spare">
<p style="color:black;">You decide to spare it, you're in its territory anyway. After it sees you put your weapons down, it speaks to you. It tells you to escape. As you tried to process the fact a plant just spoke to you  the plant monster gets attacked by the knights. The plant monster held them off as he reurged you to escape. Knowing you couldn't help them you run off. You make it to a glass door. You see words on it but can hear that they defeated the plant and are coming for you so you have no time to read it. Pushing through the door you vow to come back stronger and get revenge for the death of the creature that saved your life
</p>
<span><p  style="color:black;"class = "escape-escape-escape">Escape</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "spare-attack">
<p style="color:black;">You decide to fight it. You can't let such a dangerous monster walk around, it could hurt somebody! Surprisingly you manage to beat it. You decide to move forward in search of other dangerous monsters as you see a human building and head towards it. You find a large glass door and read the sign. Your heart drops and your head goes empty. Both because of what you realized and the spear sticking through your chest. You fall to the ground and pass out
</p>
<span><p  style="color:black;" class = "escape-escape-tooLate">sleep</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "attack-attack-attack">
<p style="color:black;">You approach the town and come to a glass door. After reading the words on the sign you charged out of the door, destroying everything in your sight. Finally after a while you break out.
</p>
<span><p  style="color:black;" class = "engage-engage-engageEnd">Rampage</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "attack-attack-spare">
<p>You decide to wait awhile and after calming down you walk into the town and find a huge glass door. You read the sign and you stare in disbelief. You quickly escaped as fast as you could. Out the door out the building out the facility past the blaring sirens, the screeching tires and the gunshots until the sounds stopped.
</p>
<span><p class = "engage-engage-escapeEnd">Run</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "attack-spare-spare">
<p>You decide to wait awhile. The plant monster lays its head next to you. In that moment you could have sworn you heard it say thank you. Freaked out you decide to move forward towards the camp.  You find yourself at a glass wall. In the center sits a glass door with the words experiment #313- human-mutation. You are filled with rage and sorrow as you realize what happened. You decide to take revenge on the people who did this to you and the plant.
</p>
<span><p class = "engage-escape-escapeEnd">Destroy</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class = "attack-spare-attack">
<p style="color:black;">You find yourself at a glass wall. In the center sits a glass door with the words experiment #313- human mutation. Realizing what this place is and what you are you realize this injustice cannot stand and that you need to stop this. Not only in this moment but from ever happening again. So you set out to do just that.
